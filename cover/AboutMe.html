  <main role="main" class="inner cover">
    <p class="lead">I started my love for languages in a different area,
      studying Sign Language at GRCC, because I was working at a company called Alternative Pathways.
      Taking care of adults with mental and physical disabilities,
      I started learning because my main client happened to be deaf.
      <br>
I fell away from that role when my family began to grow.
So I went back to college to learn auto mechanics.
I started a job at Borgman ford while I was still learning,
I was hired as a Quick lane technician,
I started showcasing my knowledge by asking to take on jobs that required more knowledge and understanding.
While performing these jobs I was asked to transition over to the used car department.
When I was at a loss, I would turn to the internet, as most people do. I would find myself,
more often than not, finding the answers quickly but without the actual physical knowledge of how to
perform the tasks, still taking longer than I would have liked on the jobs.
<br>
Realizing that maybe automotive wasn’t for me,
I went back to school again. I went to a bootcamp for C# and found that I was in love with it.
I learned quickly and gained rapport with the other students.
I was enjoying myself everyday, even if the problems that I was solving were small,
but frustrating. Come Final Project time,
I remember Sweating profusely on a stage in front of about 100 or so people that had come just to see the project that my team and I were working on.
